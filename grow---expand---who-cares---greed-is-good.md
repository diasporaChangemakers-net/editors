didn't mean that one in a bad way ;-)

hi [Gaia](https://twitter.com/la_gaia) this started as an email so i decided to leave it that way as the general vibe is we are all in for a convo these days, right ;-)

here's the run down - express edition for [diasporachangemakers.net](http://diasporachangemakers.net/)

* [open.diasporachangemakers.net](http://open.diasporachangemakers.net/)
* [devblog.diasporachangemakers.net](http://devblog.diasporachangemakers.net/)
* [docs.diasporachangemakers.net](http://docs.diasporachangemakers.net/)
* [playmakers.diasporachangemakers.net](http://playmakers.diasporachangemakers.net/)

and to make it super fast:

* [neighbrs.org](http://neighbrs.org/)
* [bleach.neighbrs.org](http://bleach.neighbrs.org/)
* [leanderroad.neighbrs.org](http://leanderroad.neighbrs.org/#)

here's the run down - email edition: 

I went through a lot of ideas, crammed in a small space and which concern [diasporachangemakers.net](http://diasporachangemakers.net/) as i envisaged it and as i was committed to build

there was always a lot of conceptual trawling so no matter how you do it it is either a document with lots of short sentences or barely legible statements with photos, vids and links or as pages of pages of paragraphs of sentences of wordy wordiness and other such tldr so i went for quick method...

so as i am now moving away from admin i decided to use some of the stuff i work with now plus text i needed for our co-op over at [diasporachangemakers.net](http://diasporachangemakers.net/) and use it as lorem ipsum kind of thing and in this way build documentation and save time ... 

(i hope you get the picture. generally on the front end there is a lot of scope to test even most unlikely connections. my thing is to test new web tech to present text in web browser and this is only on one of the many levels of abstraction available to developers these days ... web is like a smelly onion, healthy and layered ;-))

here it is after edits;

I'm very excited about edgeryders - I can't look into it though because I know how this would demolish the schedule I set out to myself some months ago - you see I am not really a cms person either and already feel i'm too far on the wrong side of the barricade ;-)

in terms of this work of mine aka [diasporachangemakers.net](http://diasporachangemakers.net/) i think i  can ease off on admin and build some content instead ... so ...

which is where i was hijacked! for details check out [bleach.neighbrs.org](http://bleach.neighbrs.org/) 

my first proposal would be something which i think we all agree would result in some material for the blog and that is weekly data viz workshops with your enlightened self as an [all mighty data visualisation analyst](https://twitter.com/la_gaia) and my enlightened self as at [java script ninja](https://github.com/rafszul) :-)

simply speaking we could meet up and work alongside like we did before, but this time we have some means to organise editing, approvals and all the rest but also make it easier for others to join and quickly get up to speed with all the whys and wherefores

as long as data is safe we don't really need any management system which doesn't mean it isn't useful to have one. it usually helps to do the extra if the costs are low. so essentially a team of editors on the project we might want to **consider expanding** our team.

we need someone to put more work on the **social media front!** 

we need it quickly, we need it to be good and **we need it yesterday!**

there is a list of twitter handles to all profile pages of those who were sent the link to this repo and who for one reason or another might find information in this file useful (the page was originally posted on [svbtle](http://rafszul.svbtle.com/preview/020uiH9KXHMVlAxidlc/) and [medium](https://medium.com/@rafszul/895a83be9ce9)) and was intended as part of "on-boarding"). you might not know them or might find the whole concept a bit like "what [has this guy got to do with this guy](http://bleach.neighbrs.org/2014/06/06/bleach_v16_62/)" kind of thing but it's all about cross-functional teams these days, right? so let's keep it that way ;-)

anyway i encourage you to look through the site(s)

- [open.diasporachangemakers.net](http://open.diasporachangemakers.net/),
- [devblog.diasporachangemakers.net](http://devblog.diasporachangemakers.net/),
- [docs.diasporachangemakers.net](http://docs.diasporachangemakers.net/)
- [bleach.neighbrs.org](http://bleach.neighbrs.org/) for fun //can i ask a favour, do you know italian by any chance? i need someone speaking italian to listen to the song there and only confirm i won't make an idiot out of myself making a cyberpunk web animation to it :-) here's the track if you will find some time (http://bleach.neighbrs.org/2014/07/17/burning/)
- and soon to come new and shiny [dataviz.diasporachangemakers.net](http://dataviz.diasporachangemakers.net/) which i intend to populate with relevant "lorem ipsum" but i would hope to have our original stuf there soon. 

which might let us hook up with people who made this [visualisation](https://nodexlgraphgallery.org/Pages/Graph.aspx?graphID=22312) which looks a lot like [the stuff i was doing](http://open.diasporachangemakers.net/about/) months ago (i will patch up anonymised version and send it to you just for fun as you are probably having way too much fun with the data from edge raiders ;-)) 

btw who is [matthew taylor](http://www.matthewtaylorsblog.com/author/matthewtaylor/) and what are the rules of engagement if any? i need feedback on this one soon as i like to shift my links around as you can see :-)

okay so click through links in the articles, look through texts, headers, media etc. you'll see some pages you are visiting are hosted on network [neighbrs.org](http://neighbrs.org/) which is an exact copy of [diasporachangemakers.net](http://diasporachangemakers.net/) and which was our test case for setting up workflows that could fit with entrepreneurs and changemakers alike but also with project/community managers like [salome](https://twitter.com/salomesimoes)

we could build quickly many of these and it is somewhat effective but the real difference happens on the ground. literally conversations are staring and need to continue on the street. (i wonder sometimes why i even feel i need to tell you this stuff? i read your article, you know all this stuff!) anyway we need to facilitate conversation on such networks from many perspectives. grassroots is one side, technical shell is another and  digital pr is yet another one. I already mentioned this to you some time ago when for the first time we spoke of [@noelito](https://twitter.com/noelito) well it was bound to come back to us so i took the liberty to invite him and some other people to this wiki. we have some work that needs doing so we need to find a way to make sure it happens. i have a good deal to everyone and we all will benefit greatly from taking part in it (literally commitment of 15-30 minutes per day and you can do it on your phone while waiting for the bus or tube)  

but it is not exactly a hiring process that i want to propose. details soon as there are many people to please :-) the whole thing is more like [@LindseyStirling's](https://twitter.com/LindseyStirling) "[like it favourite share it](http://bleach.neighbrs.org/2014/07/14/radioactive/)" and i am confident you'll find some of the stuff they do pretty interesting. actually once you are done i encourage you to check out my other take on the same material this time with lawyers involved ;-)

btw i enjoyed your article(s) a lot, great work

_this is aside:_
_the links on this page are all written in markup and you can see here is a raw view of GitHub flavoured markdown as it is called among geeks with a twist towards viz_

_in fact it is only an iframe published here so you can copy and paste it on your own blog via twitter api_

_it's nothing new and I have it set up for years now like many others but I never used it properly_

_all in all you need to hook this structure onto something (which relates to cms's idea mentioned before) usually you would do those with cms_

_I found GitHub to be the best implementation of an open platform and that's what essentially I would like to go for_

_i am not alone having such inclination (from [uk gov](https://twitter.com/gdsteam) to [digital shamans](https://twitter.com/kozilekmusic) and people they work with)_

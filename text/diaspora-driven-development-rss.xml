      <title>African philanthropy: the new drivers of development</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/may/07/africa-diaspora-philanthropy-development</link>
      <description>Remittances to Africa could transform local philanthropy and put the continent on path of self development&lt;p&gt;When you think of philanthropy in Africa what names come to mind? Bill Gates, Bono, Ford Foundation, Soros, Charity Water, World Bank, or Oxfam? If so, you are justified: they have occupied much of the discourse on development, charity and philanthropy in Africa. But you are wrong if you think philanthropy and development in Africa is limited only to their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Media and public discourse in the west present aid-dependant African development and private philanthropy, supported by the passionate advocacy of celebrities and wealthy individuals. But this is only partly true.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/may/07/africa-diaspora-philanthropy-development"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Going home: adjusting to life and work after repatriation</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/mar/07/un-new-york-cameroon-repatriation</link>
      <description>Moving back to your home country after a long time away can be difficult. After 20 years in New York, a UN adviser describes returning to Cameroon&lt;p&gt;I moved to New York in 1984 when my late husband was appointed permanent representative for Cameroon to the UN. At the time, Africa was in a major economic crisis and a drought. The UN general assembly and security council debates were not enough. It was time to engage with civil society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I soon started working for the UN myself, in Unifem (now UN Women), UN department of economic and social affairs and the office of the special co-ordinator for Africa. I co-founded the Advocates for African Food Security in 1986, was a founding member and president of the UN African Mothers' Association and co-founded &lt;a href="http://www.africanactiononaids.org/index.php" title=""&gt;African Action on Aids&lt;/a&gt;. As a UN staff member dealing with issues related to poverty eradication, I felt uncomfortable when I heard demeaning portrayals of my home country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/mar/07/un-new-york-cameroon-repatriation"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Decent work for youths: it's not about us vs them</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jan/23/youth-unemployment-diaspora-job-creation</link>
      <description>We no longer live in 'first, second, and third worlds', but are instead united by a seemingly inexorable rise in joblessness&lt;p&gt;Our discussion of the issue of youth unemployment often magics away the politics of a globalised world and leaves us just with well-intentioned, country specific, projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Youth unemployment is a global problem, although its manifestations in the poorest countries are all the more stark.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jan/23/youth-unemployment-diaspora-job-creation"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/nov/07/diaspora-bond-conference-if-campaign</link>
      <description>Diaspora-led NGOs are often on the margins of the sector. What will it take to establish meaningful partnerships? Caspar van Vark reports from  the Bond annual conference&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/jan/30/migrants-billions-overshadow-aid" title=""&gt;global remittances tripling over the past decade&lt;/a&gt; and now outstripping official aid, diaspora groups and international NGOs urgently need to find ways of working together more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was one of the messages at the &lt;a href="http://www.bond.org.uk" title=""&gt;Bond&lt;/a&gt; 2013 conference, where the theme was 'bringing innovation back into development'.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/nov/07/diaspora-bond-conference-if-campaign"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Are celebrity advocates and blogging expats crowding out African voices? A new fellowship is finding that while the media might be ready, after being so long ignored, young leaders aren't&lt;p&gt;At a 2012 TEDxChange conference in Berlin, African women's development fund CEO &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfIQgPb7pQs" title=""&gt;Theo Sowa&lt;/a&gt; turned the spotlight on an uncomfortable truth: African women may be the focus of many development campaigns, but they are rarely represented as drivers of the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When people portray us as victims, they don't want to ask us about solutions. Because people don't ask victims for solutions,&amp;quot; Sowa told the audience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/aug/23/aspen-new-voices-africa-fellowship"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>How to  mobilise a diaspora movement</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/may/31/how-to-mobilise-diaspora-movement</link>
      <description>As the British government pushes for more engagement with diaspora communities, here are six ways to build a network&lt;p&gt;Mobilising a successful African diaspora movement is challenging but essential in the current climate. There are new opportunities and more interest from the British government in engaging diaspora communities, with many diasporans now returning home to take up opportunities in the development sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, those in the UK continue to have strong links with their home countries and need a platform for developing a common plan of action. The time is ripe to motivate the African diaspora and diaspora organisations to inform, shape and support the international development process. We need to build on the current momentum to ensure visible and sustainable action.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/may/31/how-to-mobilise-diaspora-movement"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Funding and partnerships key challenges for African diasporas  study</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/may/01/african-diaspora-global-development</link>
      <description>Africa Europe Platform project shows how diasporas can overcome limitations and influence global development initiatives&lt;p&gt;Funding and working in partnership emerged as the key challenges and limitations for diaspora organisations in a recent study conducted by the Centre of African Studies and School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty-five Europe-based African diaspora organisations participated in the study. Most of these organisations were located in France, Belgium, Germany or the UK, and some in Spain, Lithuania, Malta, Switzerland, and Italy. The research aimed to investigate good practices and to collect examples of successful development projects. Though not providing final data, the findings offer some practical lessons for both diaspora organisations and development practitioners in developed countries engaging the diasporas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/may/01/african-diaspora-global-development"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Diaspora groups: how to be seen and heard</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/apr/22/diaspora-development-capacity-building</link>
      <description>Diaspora groups are increasingly mentioned in development literature, but how do they build the capacity they need to influence the agenda? Join the debate, Thursday 25 April&lt;p&gt;In '&lt;a href="http://" title=""&gt;Realising the Development Potential of Diasporas&lt;/a&gt;', a book published in 2011, its authors write: &amp;quot;Increasing attention is being given in both public and private forums to the issue of how the growing diasporas from the developing world could promote development in their homelands. Indeed, diaspora involvement in development opportunities in the homeland has increased significantly during the past decade.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a fact the international development community and policymakers  both in host countries and countries of origin  are waking up to. But the debate has often been limited to &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development-professionals-network/2013/feb/08/migration-and-development-policy-recommendations?INTCMP=SRCH" title=""&gt;capitalising on remittances&lt;/a&gt; and much of the literature focuses on how other organisations can benefit from diaspora groups, rarely on capacity building for these collectives which are often informally organised, staffed by volunteers and ill-equipped to make the kind of impact that matches their commitment to the home nations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/apr/22/diaspora-development-capacity-building"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>What Amref learned from its campaign to engage with African diaspora</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/mar/06/amref-africas-health-in-africas-hands</link>
      <description>One year on since launching 'Africa's health in African hands', Lucy Scanlon looks back on its achievements and lessons&lt;p&gt;In December 2011, Amref UK launched '&lt;a href="http://amref.ichameleon.com/news/khkh/putting-africas-health-in-africas-hands-amrefs-first-diaspora-unity-event/" title=""&gt;Africa's health in African hands&lt;/a&gt;' campaign to get together African diaspora and build a lasting network. It was the culmination of a strategy to focus on African diaspora and raise awareness, after realising that despite being well known in countries where we work only one in 100 people in the UK know about Amref.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fundraising was definitely one of the motivators behind the campaign but so too was living our values. In the words of Dr Teguest Guerma, Amref's director general: &amp;quot;Africans should not always look to western donors to help us solve our problems. We too must put something toon the table.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/mar/06/amref-africas-health-in-africas-hands"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>How to improve diaspora engagement</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/feb/20/improving-asian-diaspora-insitutions</link>
      <description>Asian governments serious about engaging diaspora groups more effectively must commit to building the capacity of the institutions they create&lt;p&gt;Policymakers in the Asia-Pacific region increasingly recognise the value that diaspora populations bring to development efforts at home. Some governments in the region have taken an extra step in institutionalising their engagement with the diaspora by creating special offices or directorates within government agencies. Within Asia, 14 government institutions were created specifically to engage diasporas on a formal basis, occupying different levels of government and exhibiting diverse priorities and degrees of organisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/feb/20/improving-asian-diaspora-insitutions"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Letters: So-called brain drain proving a net gain for developing countries</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/feb/06/brain-drain-net-gain-development-letters</link>
      <description>People who left for Europe and America are now helping their home countries to progress  it's time to involve them in development policy and planning&lt;p&gt;I have always been of the opinion that the so-called brain drain will later turn to major gain for the developing region. Diaspora has major role to play in the development. They have not just gained more knowledge in broader sense, but also developed strong skills, network and gained first hand experience on many development issues. Among the diaspora there are successful entrepreneurs and those who have taken governance, strategic and operational roles. According to the World Bank, remittance is increasing, $530bn (&amp;pound;338bn) has been remitted by people in the diaspora to their countries in 2012, despite the global economic crisis. And remittance in going towards direct development in their countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the focus should be on how they could be involved in development policy and planning, particularly by international agencies and governments in the developed countries. They should also be involved in accountability and transparency framework of development, not just for the government but also for national civil society and third sectors in the developing countries - who, in my own opinion, often operate losely and aren't monitored. Not all developing nations have a Charity Commission.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/feb/06/brain-drain-net-gain-development-letters"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>How the African diaspora is using social media to influence development</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/feb/06/african-diaspora-social-media-tms-ruge</link>
      <description>So long as our collective voice and our money continue to engage the continent, our political influence won't be far behind&lt;p&gt;Something transformational has been happening online: African voices have begun populating social media, quickly becoming the undisputed champions of development punditry. No longer are we faced with what the Nigerian writer &lt;a href="http://www.l3.ulg.ac.be/adichie/" title=""&gt;Chimamanda Adichie&lt;/a&gt; called &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story.html" title=""&gt;the danger of a single story&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;. Twitter, Facebook and other forms of social media are bringing African voices and new, varied narratives to the forefront. And, what's even more remarkable, is that these online platforms are not being used for simple pontification and acerbic commentary (although there's a fair bit of that as well). These tools are also being used to replace staid development paradigms, by organising and developing African-driven institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One form of social media in particular has had a noticeable effect. Twitter's short messaging network has revolutionised political discourse and rewritten the rules of international development dialogue. Controversial development projects such as the &lt;a href="http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/12-084_8c3c25f4-54e5-4ce3-9b46-45bdebe43ea6.pdf" title=""&gt;#1millionshirts campaign&lt;/a&gt; (pdf  see page 11) and Invisible Children's &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/03/09/kony-2012-and-the-potential-of-social-media-activism" title=""&gt;Kony 2012&lt;/a&gt; video came under heavy diaspora scrutiny online. Invisible Children's video campaign to capture the notorious Ugandan rebel &lt;a href="http://www.theafricareport.com/tag/joseph-kony.html" title=""&gt;Joseph Kony&lt;/a&gt; became a victim of its own success and was dismissed as &amp;quot;over-simplified&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;misleading&amp;quot; by many prominent voices in the diaspora. Likewise, &lt;a href="http://aidwatchers.com/2010/05/time-magazine-covers-1million-shirts/" title=""&gt;the negative feedback&lt;/a&gt; against the #1millionshirts campaign  a project to dump 1 million T-shirts into the African marketplace  was so powerful that founder Jason Sadler pulled the plug on it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/feb/06/african-diaspora-social-media-tms-ruge"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Diaspora-driven development: how to turn wealth to health in Bangladesh</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/feb/05/bangladesh-diaspora-development-health-wealth</link>
      <description>Policymakers need to understand the diaspora and incentivise its involvement in the country's development&lt;p&gt;Sylhet division in north-east Bangladesh, where around &lt;a href="http://www.gscuk.org/history.html" title=""&gt;95% of all British-Bengalis trace their origin to&lt;/a&gt;, should in theory be the wealthiest and healthiest part of country. The region receives around &lt;a href="http://www.bhclondon.org.uk/Remittance.html" title=""&gt;US $1bn in remittances every year&lt;/a&gt; from expatriate Bengalis in the UK alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, wealth hasn't translated to health in Sylhet. According to the &lt;a href="http://www.bbs.gov.bd/Home.aspx" title=""&gt;Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics&lt;/a&gt;, Sylhet has worse literacy and school enrolment rates than all other regions, child malnutrition rates are well over the WHO emergency threshold of 15%, fertility rates are the highest in the country and expectant mothers are more likely to die during child birth in Sylhet than any other part of Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/feb/05/bangladesh-diaspora-development-health-wealth"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Malaria and the diaspora</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/feb/04/malaria-prevention-awareness-diaspora</link>
      <description>The African diaspora in the UK could play a key role in malaria prevention awareness in countries where the disease is endemic&lt;p&gt;In 2011, the UK's Health Protection Agency recorded &lt;a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/NewsCentre/NationalPressReleases/2012PressReleases/120425Malaria/" title=""&gt;1,677 cases of malaria&lt;/a&gt; in the country. The majority of cases were members of the diaspora who had gone to visit friends or relatives. When the figures were released on World Malaria Day 2012, the HPA said that the figures illustrated the common misconception among the diaspora that they are immune to malaria, and that prevention messages were clearly not getting through to these communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Annemarie Meyer, Africa programmes and policy manager at &lt;a href="http://malarianomore.org.uk/" title=""&gt;Malaria No More UK&lt;/a&gt;, this is a missed opportunity on two counts: first because the disease is entirely preventable, and second because the diaspora represents a potentially powerful ally in the fight against malaria. &amp;quot;A lot of diaspora members have connections with businesses, politicians or the media in malaria-endemic countries,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;They have the opportunity to influence them and engage them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/feb/04/malaria-prevention-awareness-diaspora"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
